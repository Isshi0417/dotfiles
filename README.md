# Dotfiles
These are my pesonal dotfiles for my own setup. There aren't that many packages
 because I use it for school and beginner programming tools. The installation 
scripts are for replicating my personal setup on any other computer. They 
install the packages, and post-install script sets up any installed programs 
that need some configurations. Config files are symlinked via GNU Stow.

Currently planning to work on Hyprland dotfiles...
